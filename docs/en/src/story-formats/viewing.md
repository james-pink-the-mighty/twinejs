# Viewing Story Formats

To view a list of story formats installed in your version of Twine, choose
_Story Formats_ from the _Twine_ top toolbar tab. By default, the Story Formats
dialog will show you the newest version of every story format you have
installed. Each item represents a single format that's installed. This list
shows both regular story formats and proofing ones together, and is sorted
alphabetically by name.

Story formats that come installed with Twine have a sticker on them labeled
"Built In." The [default story format](default.md) has a sticker on it labeled
"Used as Default," and the format that's used for proofing stories has a "Used
for Proofing" sticker. These formats also have a blue background in the list to
make them easier to locate.

If Twine isn't able to load a story format, it will show an error symbol on its
card with a short explanation of the error it encountered.

The dialog has a button that allows you to choose what formats are shown:

- _Current Story Formats_ shows only the newest version of each story format.
- _User-Added Story Formats_ shows only formats you have added.
- _All Story Formats_ shows all formats installed, including older versions of formats.
