# Changing the Proofing Format

To change the proofing format, use the _Use As Proofing Format_ button below it.
A "Used for Proofing" sticker will appear on the card to confirm the change. If
the _Use As Proofing Format_ button is disabled, the format you've selected is
already the proofing format, or the format you've selected is not a proofing
format. (In that case, you probably want to [set it as your default
format](default.md) instead.)
