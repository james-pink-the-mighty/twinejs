# Changing the Default Story Format

To change the default story format, use the _Use as Default Format_ button below
it. A "Used as Default" sticker will appear on the card to confirm the change.
If the _Use As Default_ button is disabled, the format you've selected is
already the default format, or the format you've selected is for proofing. (In
that case, you probably want to [set it as your proofing format](proofing.md)
instead.)

Changing the default story format doesn't affect stories you've already created,
only new ones you create in the future. You [can change the story format for
existing stories](../editing-stories/changing-story-format.md) in the Story Map
screen.
