# Adding a Story Format

To add a story format, you'll need to know its address. A story format should
include this in its documentation. A story format address must be a URL, with a
prefix like `https://` in front of it.

Once you know your story format's address, choose _Add_ at the top of the Story
Formats dialog and enter it in the dialog that appears. If Twine is able to load
the story format from the address you've entered, it will show a preview of the
format name and version you're adding. Choose _Add_ in the dialog to add it.
It'll appear in the list of story formats immediately. You can now either [set
it as the default story format](default.md) or [change individual
stories](../editing-stories/changing-story-format.md) to use it, if you like.
