# Disabling Story Format Extensions

Story formats can extend Twine by adding:

- References between passages, which appear as dotted lines connecting passages
  in the Story Map screen
- A toolbar in passage edit dialogs
- Syntax coloring in passage edit dialogs

If these extensions are buggy or you just prefer not to use them, you can
disable them. To do this, uncheck the _Use Editor Extensions_ checkbox under the
story format's name in the dialog. To reverse this change, check this checkbox.

Disabling extensions disables all extensions for a format. You can't disable
just the toolbar, for example, but not a format's references or syntax coloring.
